Kumiko's Genshin Wish Sim API

<div align="left">

# Info

Kumiko, a Discord bot built on top of [Rin](https://github.com/No767/Rin), is designed to allow for maximum flexibility and freedom within its services. Kumiko also includes a Genshin Impact Wish Simulator, which acts just like how Genshin Wishes work (directly integrated into Discord). Problem becomes where to host the assets for all of the items and characters? Well this is a solution to that. This repo contains the backend API code needed to serve static assets for Kumiko's Genshin Wish Sim (GWS).

# API Info

Currently this is subject to development, so the API is not yet complete. But this is built on FastAPI. Docs should be available on http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc. This API requires no databases, since the bulk of the work is done directly on Kumiko.
